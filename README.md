# The Quantum Address & Observation-Induced Time Dilation Framework  
**Storm Brash – Draft 2025**

A new interpretive framework that re-casts measurement, the Quantum Zeno effect, entanglement, decoherence, and the emergence of time itself as consequences of **observation-induced time dilation** and **address conservation** in a computationally minimal universe.

## One-sentence summary
Observation doesn’t collapse anything — it slows down the observed system’s proper time.

## Key ideas
- Three fundamental laws (Address Conservation, Temporal Coherence, Synchronization Dynamics)
- Quantum Zeno = time dilation, not freezing
- Entanglement = shared proper time
- Thermodynamics emerges from the universe trying to re-synchronize fragmented proper times
- Cosmological expansion is the mechanism that lets internal time emerge
